        <h1 class="heading"> 23 Statement of <span> Faith </span></h1>
        <h2 style="color: grey"> <i>GO</i> and Make a <b>DISCIPLE</b> </h2>
            <ul> 

            <li>1.What we believe.
               <br> The Victory Church believes that Jesus Christ is the Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Soon-Coming King.</li><br>
            <li>2. We stand firm on the foundation set by, 
               <br> (1Corinthians 15:57-58 KJV).</li><br>
            <li>3. Declaration of Faith.
               <br> The Holy Scriptures.
               <br> We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God; it is absolutely true, enduring, and unchangeable (2Timothy 3:16-17,Matthew 24:35)</li><br>
            <li>4. The Eternal Godhead.
               <br> We believe in the Trinity of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. The three parts of the Trinity are coexistent and coeternal,which means that they always have existed and always will exist together; they are coequal in divine perfection, which means that no person of the Trinity is more powerful or more perfect than any other person in the Trinity. (1John 5:7)</li><br>
            <li>5. The Fall of Man. 
               <br> We believe that Adam and Eve, the precursors of the entire human race, were created in the image of God; however, they disobeyed God and became sinners. Through Adam, all people inherited sin's nature and consequences, and all are in need of a redeemer. (Genesis 1:27; Romans 5:12-19)</li><br>
            <li>6. The Plan of Redemption.
               <br> We believe that Christ died for all of us while we were still sinners; He took the punishment for our sin. With his own blood, He purchased salvation and redemption for all who believe in Him (John 3:16; Isaiah 53:5; Titus 2:14).</li><br>
            <li>7. Salvation through Grace.
               <br> We believe that salvation is totally an act of God's grace that is accessed through faith in Jesus Christ. No person can be good enough to earn salvation, and "being good" does not contribute to receiving God's love and favor. (Ephesians 2:8-13)</li><br>
            <li>8. Repentance and Acceptance.
               <br> We believe that, when people repent for their sins and accept Christ, they are justified through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. To repent means to be sorry for sins, but it also means to turn away from sinful lifestyle. Accepting Christ means believing in him as the only Savior. To be justified means being declared "not guilty" in regard to sin. (Romans 10:9-10; John 1:9)</li><br>
            <li>9. The New Birth.
               <br> We believe that the change that takes place in people when they are "born again" is very real. They receive righteousness through Jesus Christ, and they are empowered by the Holy Spirit; therefore, they should have new desires, interests and pursuits. (John 3:3; 2Corinthians 5:17)</li><br>
            <li>10. Daily Christian Life.
               <br> We believe that people who have been born again grow in sanctification-which means that they separate themselves from the value system of the world and embrace and live according to the values of the kingdom that Jesus proclaimed. As they do so, they increase holiness, faith, power, prayer, love and service. (2Corinthians 7:1)</li><br>
            <li>11. Water Baptism, The Lord's Supper and Holy Matrimony.
               <br> A. We believe that people who have been born again should be baptized in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Jesus himself was baptized and instructed his followers to be baptized. Baptism also confirms that Christ is the Lord and King in each believer's life. (Romans 6:4) <br>
               <br> B. We believe in observing the Lord's Supper, or Communion, just as Jesus instructed. This means that born again believers take the broken bread and the fruit of the vine as a remembrance and celebration of the new life that is theirs because of Jesus' death on the cross and his resurrection. It is also looking forward to his return as triumphant King. (1Corinthians 11:24-26) <br> 
               <br> C. We believe on "THE SACREDNESS OF MARRIAGE." Marriage is one of the holiest of relations two people can have. Marriage is a bond created by God himself, thus we must treat, it as sacred. Marriage is not something to be entered into lightly. "Our Fellowship must defend the sanctity of marriage." (Genesis 2:17-24; Matthew 19:3-5; Hebrews 13:4)<br>
               <br> D. Baptism of the Holy Spirit. We believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience that follows salvation. All believers have God's Spirit within them. Holy Spirit baptism empowers believers to exalt Jesus, to live lives of Holiness, and to be witnesses of God's saving grace. We believe that those who experience Holy Spirit Baptism today will experience it in the same manner that believers experienced it in the early church; in other words, we believe that they will speak in tongues-languages that are not known to them. (Acts 1:5-8; Acts 2:4)</li><br>
            <li>12. The Spirit-Filled Life.
               <br> We believe that born again believers should be people who pray and who allow the Holy Spirit to shape their values and behaviors everyday; their lives should exemplify love, honesty and sincerity. (Ephesian 4:30-32)</li><br>
            <li>13. The Gifts and Fruit of the Spirit.
               <br> We believe that the Holy Spirit gives ministry gifts to believers; in other words, the Holy Spirit gives people special abilities for ministry. These gifts will build up groups of believers and help them mature in Christian faith (1Corinthians 12:1-11).Further, Spirit-filled believers should show the spiritual "fruit" that has been given to them: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, self-control. (Romans 12:6-8; Galatians 5:22-25)</li><br>
            <li>14. Moderation.
               <br> We believe that the Christians should avoid excess and that their moderation should be obvious to others. Their commitment to Christ should be deep and sincere, but they should not indulge in or lead other into extremes of fanaticism. Christians should be well thought of balanced, humble and self-sacrificing, reflecting Christ's grace and character in all areas of their lives. (Colossians 3:12-13; Philippians 4:5)</li><br>
            <li>15. Divine Healing.
               <br> We believe that Jesus Christ heals people who are sick. God does not change; He is still willing and able to heal the body, as well as the Soul and Spirit, in response to faith. (Mark 16:17-18; James 5:14-16)</li><br>
            <li>16. The Second Coming of Christ.
               <br> We believe that the second coming of Christ is personal and imminent; we are as certain that His second coming will occur as we are that His first coming is a historical fact. No one knows the exact time of His coming, but believers will continue to spread the gospel around the world until He does come again. At the time the Lord Himself will descend from heaven, the dead Christians will be resurrected, and believers will be taken up to meet the Lord in the air. (Matthew 24:36, 42-44; 1Thessalonians 4:16-17)</li><br>
            <li>17. Church Relationship.
               <br> We believe that it is essential for all believers to join with and become part of a congregation of other believers. It is important to worship together, observe the ordinances of the church, encourage and support one another, and work together to advance the Lord's Kingdom. (Hebrews 10:24-25)</li><br>
            <li>18. Civil Government.
               <br> We believe that civil government is established by divine appointment; civil laws should be upheld at all times except when they are in opposition to the Word of God. (Romans 13:1-7) </li><br>
            <li>19. Judgment.
               <br> We believe that everyone will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Born again believers will be sent to a place of everlasting life, and non believers will be sent to a place of everlasting punishment. (Revelation 20:11-12; 2Corinthians 5:10) </li><br>
            <li>20. Heaven.
               <br> We believe that heaven is the habitation of the living God and the eternal home of born again believers. (John 14:2; Revelation 7:15-17)</li><br>
            <li>21. Hell.
               <br> We believe that hell is a place of darkness, deep sorrow and unquenchable fire, which was not prepared for man but for the devil and his angels; it will become the place of eternal separation from God for all who reject Christ as Savior. (Matthew 13:41-42; Revelation 20:10-15)</li><br>
            <li>22. Evangelism.
               <br> We believe that evangelizing and making disciples is the primary "business" of the church; every hindrance to worldwide evangelism should be removed. (James 5:20; Mark 16:15)</li><br>
            <li>23. Tithing and Offerings.
               <br> We believe that tithing (giving 10 percent of earnings) and offerings (amounts determined by the individuals) are God's instruments to carry on his ministry, spread the gospel, and release personal blessing (Malachi 3:10; 1Corinthians 16:1-2)</li><br>
